# Data-Science-Internship-Project
Project on Stock Price Prediction Using different Regression Algorithms
# Algorithms Used for prediction are:
## Linear Regression Algorithms:
### 1. SGD Regressor Algorithm
### 2. Random Forest Regression Algorithm
### 3. SVM Regressor Algorithm

## For Best Results:
### Applied data preprocessing to remove null values, duplicate values.
### Feature Engineering is done to get much more accurate results.

# Accuracy:
## SGD Regressor model Accuracy is 97.6%
## Random Forest model Accuracy is also 97.6%
## SVM Regressor model has an accuracy of -69.7%
